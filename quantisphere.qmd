## Key Features

- Microsecond-level latency routing using Neo4j path switching  
- Real-time FIX gateway simulation  
- Grafana dashboards with Prometheus metrics + alerts  
- Full Dockerized deployment pipeline  
- ELK stack log aggregation and observability  
- Deep Reinforcement Learning‚Äìbased strategy inference  

> *Custom-built to support millisecond decision making in globally distributed markets.*
