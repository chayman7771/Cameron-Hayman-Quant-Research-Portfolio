Its global latency map and WebSocket-driven dashboard provide sub-millisecond visibility into cross-exchange spreads, while Prometheus and Grafana ensure comprehensive observability, alerting, and performance monitoring at every stage of the data pipeline. Together, these components enable systematic identification and execution of latency arbitrage opportunities with enterprise-grade reliability and scalability."
